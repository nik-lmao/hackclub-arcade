# ðŸ’» | Hackclub Arcade 2024

Hackclub Arcade is a summer event where high schoolers (or younger) work on projects, get the hours they spent in tickets and can buy a cool prize with them.

## ðŸ’Ž | My participation

I decided to participate at Hackclub Arcade and built multiple simple and more complicated projects which are all located in this Github Repository. Just check out all the folders!

## ðŸ‘‘ | My experience

I had a lot of fun working on different projects. Over the last months I learnt more about interesting topics, tried out new things and was motivated all the time. (Probably because of the items in the shop ;))
