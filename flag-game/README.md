# 🌍 | Flag Guessing Game

I created a Flag Guessing Game with the help of [this API](https://flagsapi.com/). The game shows you a flag and you have to guess the country.

## 📡 | Deployment

The webpage is deployed with Github Pages and can be viewed [here](http://hackclub.nik-dev.eu/flag-game/). Have fun!

## ❓ | Questions

If you have any questions please ask it in my DMs on the Hackclub Slack (where you probably came from) or add me on Discord: @nikitafrfr
