Nikita: "So you’re coming to me? We can have a drink for a bit."
Maximilian: "Yeah, I'm on my way!"

2. **In Front of Maximilian's House**

{from behind}
Maximilian gets on his bicycle. He is calm and relaxed.

3. **In Front of Nikita's House**

The house looks normal, but the front door is slightly ajar. Maximilian calls out for Nikita but gets no response. Hesitantly, he opens the door and steps inside.

4. **Living Room**

In the living room, there is a figure under a blanket on the floor. Maximilian approaches cautiously, sees Nikita's lifeless body, and suddenly hears a chair creaking. He turns around and sees Daniel.

Maximilian: "Who are you? How did you get in here? What have you done to Nikita?"
Daniel: "I’m Dr. Daniel Schluchtenscheißer. To answer your question: He saw too much. Just like you now."
Maximilian: "What are you planning? I have a weapon."
Daniel: "It's too late. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you are already dead."

Maximilian laughs nervously.

Daniel briefly blurs and appears behind Maximilian.

Maximilian stops laughing and turns around, startled.

Maximilian: "How... how did you do that?"
Daniel laughs.
Daniel: "Too late, Mr. Saftsack."
