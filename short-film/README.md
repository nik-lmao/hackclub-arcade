# 🎬 | Short Film Scripts

This project includes two versions of a short film script:

- **script-de.txt**: The script in German.
- **script-en.txt**: The script in English.

The script revolves around Maximilian Saftsack, who discovers a disturbing scene at Nikita's house and encounters a sinister figure, Daniel Schluchtenscheißer, leading to a confrontation.

**Note:** I haven’t managed to film this yet. Maybe I'll do it in the future.
